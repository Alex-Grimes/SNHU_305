Software Security


Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They want to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect the organization from external threats.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

As a finacial company a single vulerability could be a huge target on the customer. To help prevent this we have conducted multiple maven dependecy checks and mitigated as many of these issues as possible as well as identified the ones that are not currently able to be resolved. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I found the list of all dependecys along with possible fixes all curated on a single webpage to be extreamly helpful i think in the futurre i would like to try additonal tools as well though maven seems to have done the job well but also appears to be a outdated tool for the most part. 

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I made this repositopry to show all of my work i feel like in the learrning process the mistakes made and how you respond to them tells people alot more about you then the ability to memorize and repeat what you think someone wants to hear so i would recommend a future employer views this repository and then looks at some of my later work to see the growth that came from my learning process. i ensured that the software was funticonal through dynamic testing and repeat dependcy checks to ensure that no new vullnerabiltys were introduced after changes this allowed me to keep a visual on possible issues the entire time.
